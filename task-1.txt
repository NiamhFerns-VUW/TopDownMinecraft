A)
Cells.forAll() is currently used preform actions on other Cells that are within a specific range. (Done via visitor pattern.)

B)
We could use this to implement an AoE ability where the character performs an attack on Coord p and int range determines the size of that
AoE attack. A fire spell for example that sets any of those cells on fire (given that our game is a top-down Minecraft-y type
game, this would be the equivilant of a ghast fireball) or a potion effect that gives buffs/debuffs to friends/enemies within a certain range 
(the Minecraft equivilant being a splash potion).
