# SWEN 225 Assignment 1

Assignment 1 for SWEN 225. 

## Note to Markers
Earlier commits on this project were done under a different username. Both usernames are mine but due to a mistake on my end, the username for my personal github account was used 
early on in this assignment.

You can find my personal github (here)[https://github.com/KaosBunny] to double check that this is in fact me.

The error was caused by me having a global username and email set on my computer. It has been corrected now.

## Running Project
The project can be run (assuming you have java 17 or greater) from the CLI with java -jar \<jar name\> or you can double clicke the jar to run it.

Keys are selected by typing in the text boxes. The last character in the textfield will be used as your keybinding for that action.

## Assignment Status
Finished!
